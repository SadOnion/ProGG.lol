# ProGG.lol

ProGG.lol is an application designed to help you in League of Legends. The main features are:
- champion select analysis - the application looks up your teammates, showing you their rank and their performance on chosen champions.
- in game analysis - ProGG.lol looks up your enemies, showing you their rank and their performance on chosen champions.
- previous champion selects - ProGG.lol saves previous (or dodged) champion selects to help you target ban enemies.

## Installation

Requires Python3.

- clone the repo
- run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- set up the `.env` file:
  - `API_MODE=riot`: get a key from https://developer.riotgames.com/ and set `API_RIOT_KEY`
  - `API_MODE=kernel`: set up https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel and set `API_KERNEL_URL` and `API_KERNEL_PORT`
  - optional: set `DEFAULT_REGION` to your region (this option preloads static data)

## Running

Currently only supports EUW and EUNE regions.

- inside repo/progglol run `python progglol.py`

The first run is going to take a while (5-10s) because the application downloads static data and then it'll ask for the game directory path.
